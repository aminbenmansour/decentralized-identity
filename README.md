# decentralized-identity

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), a new [web standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) is a type of globally unique identifier (URI) that does not require a centralized registration authority because **control of the identifier can be proved using cryptography**.

*DIDs are the atomic building block of decentralized digital trust infrastructure.* - Book: *Self-Sovereign Identity* Chapter 8: *Decentralized Identifiers*

A DID is a digital control point !

Unlike the most commonly used identifiers and proof of identity(e-mails, phone numbers) that we use nowadays in order to express ourselves and communicate, we own the control point of our identity.
